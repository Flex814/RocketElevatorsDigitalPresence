Progress Report
9/21/21:
This is the initial repository for Rocket Elevators Digital presence. So far, I have just added minor changes to the index.html, and some of the pages together. I will be making commits to a separate branch and keep the master branch clean until final product.
Today, I just plan on finishing up the index.html as much as I can. Tomorrow, I will work on the two landing pages and hopefully the quotes page. Thursday will be adding Javascript and debugging from there. I will add more as time goes on.
(update 2): updated some imgages and removed others. Removed some Lorem ipsum.
Updated portfolio some. Updated Contact Us section. Updated some Footer info.

Shifting gears to finalizing/debugging index.html and landing pages. Got embedded map to work. Tried to add an alert on message send for Contact Form, but ended up taking it out due to the page still redirecting to an error. Resized brand images that were too small to 200x200px. Resized all Portfolio images to 325x200px. In Layout.css changed .item-box-desc to text-align: center;. Ensured all buttons work on index, commercial and residential, with the exception of subscribe buttons and submit button for contact.
(Update 2): Got rid of php problem with "send message" button in contact form. Added button alert to "send message" button saying "message sent".
