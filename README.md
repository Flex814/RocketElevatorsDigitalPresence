Progress Report
9/21/21:
This is the initial repository for Rocket Elevators Digital presence. So far, I have just added minor changes to the index.html, and some of the pages together. I will be making commits to a separate branch and keep the master branch clean until final product.
Today, I just plan on finishing up the index.html as much as I can. Tomorrow, I will work on the two landing pages and hopefully the quotes page. Thursday will be adding Javascript and debugging from there. I will add more as time goes on.
(update 2): updated some imgages and removed others. Removed some Lorem ipsum.
Updated portfolio some. Updated Contact Us section. Updated some Footer info.
(test)
(Update 3) Finished rough draft of Portfolio. Deleted some Lorem ipsum.
(Update 4) Finished rough draft of team section, news section and clients section. Also started on contact section. Will stop here for the night and continue in morning.

9/22/21:
Fixed some of the News section, worked on Team section some, worked on Contact form.
(Update 2): Finished overall skeleton of index page. Added same nav bar to both residential and corporate landing pages. Completed footer of index.
(Update 3): Made index links work. Made footer for both residential and corporate. Mostly finished residential skeleton. Made some of the links working for both landing pages.
(Update 4): Finished both commercial/residential pages. Adjusted Footer. Working on Quote page.
(Update 5): Went into demo.revolution_slider.js and changed Init Revolution Slider delay to 7000 in hopes of satisfying the 7 second rule.

9/23/21:
Shifting gears to finalizing/debugging index.html and landing pages. Got embedded map to work. Tried to add an alert on message send for Contact Form, but ended up taking it out due to the page still redirecting to an error. Resized brand images that were too small to 200x200px. Resized all Portfolio images to 325x200px. In Layout.css changed .item-box-desc to text-align: center;. Ensured all buttons work on index, commercial and residential, with the exception of subscribe buttons and submit button for contact.
(Update 2): Got rid of php problem with "send message" button in contact form. Added button alert to "send message" button saying "message sent".
(Update 3): Created quoteScript.js file to link to quote.html. Added working map to quotes page. Starting to change some of the form to become ready for quote and js implementation. This will require much time researching and asking questions. Prepare for long periods of little to no visible progress.
(Update 4): Removed comments from news on index. Began adding choices for quote form. Moved the map and contact us section of quote.html to bottom of page. Added many required choice options for quote.html. Really need to figure out the js programming part :/. Successfully added every option that is required on the quote form, just not neccessarilly how it will look as a final product. Still need to hide the choices not in use and implement js.
(Update 5): Figured out some of the beginning JS for the quote page. Have some If Else statements that are supposed to show or hide options based off of user input. Still needs work, will work on more tomorrow. Already ahead of schedule I set for myself. Honestly, everytime I figure something out I feel awesome!

9/24/21:
Started making comments in JS to keep track of things. Added total value and number placeholder below quote form. Beginning to put everything in appropriate classes/IDs for js program.
(Update 1): I think I messed up. I was making the program myself without even double checking if I was following the requirements of the documentation for input fields and the building type selection. Going to meet with coach Timothy to doublecheck, but this may be not great.
(Need to do Later): Change "BlankOptions to individual choice id options" in JS, delete duplicate choices in quote.html. Delete specific "ResidentialOptioins" type divs and replace with general Choices Div. Need 3 radio buttons product lines.

9/25/21:
Mostly writing out on paper how program is supposed to run.
(Update 1): Commented out "Send message" div and "elevator amount" div on quote.html. Adding "Estimated Price" section at end of form. Set the foundation for the estimated price html and later js programming. Added Radio Button with service options. Got radio buttons working, but will probably start on refactoring the previous parts of the quote form since I did that the wrong way.

9/26/21:
Probably going to start refactoring my original Building Type Selector to make the future code easier. Got rid of useless extra code options for building type selector. Refactored the JS with the building type selectors. Refactoring has now made the show/hide program not work, so now will proceed to troubleshoot.
(Update 1): Back to having a working quotes form, but the js I've used is absolutely terrible. Constantly repeating lines of code, but I can't get it to work any other way. For now, I'm moving on. Spent way too long on something so simple.
