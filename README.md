Progress Report
9/21/21: 
This is the initial repository for Rocket Elevators Digital presence.  So far, I have just added minor changes to the index.html, and some of the pages together. I will be making commits to a separate branch and keep the master branch clean until final product. 
Today, I just plan on finishing up the index.html as much as I can. Tomorrow, I will work on the two landing pages and hopefully the quotes page. Thursday will be adding Javascript and debugging from there. I will add more as time goes on.
